<h5 id="grade-1-single-perceptron">grade 1: single perceptron</h5>

<p>It’s the initial post of series: neural network.</p>

<p>The languages will be implemented here are: javascript and processing.</p>

<p>Reason for choosing these 2, is they are easy to visualize and provides friendly interaction, which will help out in understanding “how”.</p>

<p>I believe in make “something” visible requires comprehensive understanding on “something”.</p>

<p>Won’t start from introduction of neuron &amp; brain science etc, as these staffs could be easily get online. Instead, let’s start by neuron from machine learning perspective.</p>

<p>Neural network has wide usage in all sorts of machine learning scenarios. As skyscraper was made of tiny bricks, the neural network was made of “perceptrons”.</p>

<p>Following is the diagram of simplest and basic unit of network, a processor. With millions even billions of perceptrons communicate to each other, a sophisticated system was built on top of it.</p>

<p>The target of grade 1: to build a linear classifier , which could classify 2 categories in a 2 dimension space.</p>

<p>What’s the basic functionality of a neuron , aka perceptron in machine learning terminology. Typically, a perceptron takes in inputs, sum up them, according to a “predefined” rule of judge, outputs a setting value.</p>

<p>Here, a perceptron could take in thousands and even more inputs, i.e. in image classification scenarios. While use 2 inputs here, other than simplify the scenario, 2 inputs could be project to a 2 dimension space x value and y value, which makes it easier for us to visualize.</p>

<p>First, let’s pass our initial target, make a workable perceptron, just like the 1st cell in biological evolution.</p>

<p>As a perceptron, 2 main functionalities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>sum up</li>
  <li>judge</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s start implement some codes here, following are the core codes in processing:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Perceptron {
  float[] weights;
  float learning_rate = 0.01;

  // Constructor, takes in # of weights and initialize
  Perceptron(int n) {
    weights = new float[n];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; weights.length; i++) {
      weights[i] = random(-1, 1);
    }
  }

  // Generate outputs
  int predict(float[] inputs) {
    float sum = 0;
    for (int i= 0; i &lt; weights.length; i++) {
      sum += inputs[i] * weights[i];
    }
    int predict = sign(sum);
    return predict;
  }

  // Activate function, sign is a basic function gets "+" / "-"
  int sign(float sum) {
    if (sum &gt;= 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return -1;
    }
  }

}

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How does a perceptron work, just as following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Perceptron nn;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
  nn = new Perceptron(2);
  float inputs[] = {0.5, -1};
  int predict = nn.predict(inputs);
  println(predict);
}

void draw() {
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simple like that.</p>

<p>Second, come up with a scenario, and let’s commence a classification problem, which is arbitrary divide a 2D space.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, the concept of “training” - (tweak outputs according to training set will be introduced) .</p>

<p>During training process:
How to represent “error”:
How to adjust weight</p>

<p>Math been invoked in this grade:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sum = w0*x0 + w1*x1 + ...
error = current - truth
sign
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cite from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_%28mathematics%29">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sign of a number. Every number has multiple attributes (such as value, sign and magnitude). A real number is said to be positive if its value (not its magnitude) is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will discuss the scenario of been zero later.</p>

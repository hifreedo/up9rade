<p>Subject for grade 2 is to develop a linear classification with single perceptron.</p>

<p>Grade 2:
Let’s see what does a “neuron” really get.
We will come up with a scenario, commence a classification problem: linearly split a 2D space.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, the concept of “training” - (tweak outputs according to training set will be introduced) .</p>

<p>During training process:
How to represent “error”:
How to adjust weight</p>

<p>More contents to be fulfilled.</p>

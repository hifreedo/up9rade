<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s important to address a big amount of online resources,
which may be cited in here, some of them I aware of,
some of them may be used here unconsiously.
Would try best to list the resources I used and send my sincere
thanks and respect to all of the authors.</p>

<p>Online videos:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The Coding Train by Daniel Shiffman</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sevic5Vy4E">A Gentle Introduction to Neural Networks and making your own with Python by Tariq Rashid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hsuantien/playlists">Machine Learning Foundations by Hsuan-Tien Lin</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I would really encourage you to try build a neural network from scratch,
if you really would like to master it, just like you have to jump into the pool if you really want to learn swimming.</p>

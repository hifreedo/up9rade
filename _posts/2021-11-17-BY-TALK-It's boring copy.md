# by-talk it's boring

My friends and people I know there, most of them were entitled with "principal", principal development/ test / program management manager etc.

I also found, some of them are particularly in favor of putting a picture of holding a microphone as profile photo. And someone likes to post a scene of one or two books with cup of coffee in social media.

Lord, it's boring.

It's been like a decade since I knew them. And hardly, hard for them to entitle another bigger title in coming decade.

It's really boring.

Can't help to recall a chat with a wise man decade ago, he said: there were always two types of people, the explorer and the settler.

Extremely difficult for me to let my mind hanging around one place with one group of people.

Time to set out for diving in the ocean.

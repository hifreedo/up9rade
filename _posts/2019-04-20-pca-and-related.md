# PCA and related

Principal component analysis is a methodology widely implemented in dimensionality reduction.

PCA relies on orthogonal transformation, to covert a set of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly independent / uncorrelated variables, which were called principal components.

Though tends to minimize information loss, it's a "lossy compression".

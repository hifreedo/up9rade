# What Is An Image File

All most all of the image files we are dealing with through machine learning, there are not in there "original" format, in other words, they have be compressed or transformed into certain file format.

One of the commonly used image file format is ".jpeg" or ".jpg", which usually could achieve 10:1 compression rate without sacrifice too much on the quality.

The magic of jpeg compression behind is: human vision is more sensitive to color or brightness variations in large areas than to the high frequency brightness variations. Which means we could discard some info in high frequency areas.

To have a detailed understand about jpeg formating, following are some key methodologies: 

* Huffman Coding
* Entropy Encoding
* Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

Jpeg is widely used in internet, while with the era of "5g" reaching, lossless data compression maybe will change current regime, still is interesting to know more about the source of our deep learning models' training material.

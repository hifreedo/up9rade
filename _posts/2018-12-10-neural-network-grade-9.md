# Receptive Field with CNN

## grade 9: Receptive field with CNN

Following is a sentence and image cite from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptive_field):

The receptive field of an individual sensory neuron is the particular region of the sensory space (e.g., the body surface, or the visual field) in which a stimulus will modify the firing of that neuron.

The convolution process is like to distill a sea into a drop of water, while calculating RF (receptive field) is just like to look a whole sea from a drop of water.

Convolution is to abstract higher level info from a picture, receptive field calculating is to figure out how many input elements could be counted in one single neuron.

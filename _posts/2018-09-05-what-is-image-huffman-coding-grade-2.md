# What is image file: Huffman Coding

## grade 2: huffman coding

In previous post, the introduction about [JPEG]({{site.url}}/2018/08/26/what-is-image-jpeg-heif-grade-1.html), we introduced the compression algorithm "Huffman Coding", this post is about it.

Huffman coding is widely used in:

* File compression: zip / gzip
* Image compression: jpeg / png
* Text compression: word2vec
  
A slight note about word2vec, which treats words in corpus as leaf nodes, based on words' frequency as weights, to build corresponding huffman tree.

Now as you could see, we need to understand huffman coding because it was implemented in NLP and CV domains.

There was said huffman coding was invented by David A. Huffman in 1952 while he was attending exam in MIT.

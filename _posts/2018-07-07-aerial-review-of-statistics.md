# Aerial view of statistics

Statistics is about change mind with math.

We are dealing with uncertainties everyday, are the samples/ occurances as we wish or on the contrary, will happen all the same (apply to whole population)? The traffic, weather, gambling, every piece of our life contains probabilities.

 -- | Bayesian | Frequentist
 --- | --- | ---
 focus on | Change Belief | Change Action
 result | credible intervals | confidence coefficient
 example | Winning chance: 40% ~ 60% | 55% chance, all in

Though bayesian treats the world in a more "rational" way, frequentist are more popular nowadays, maybe due to people doesn't like this kind of uncertainty either.

A typical way of statistics:

1. Make a hypotheses
2. Collect supportive data
3. Check power of data
4. Test hypotheses

$$E=MC^2$$

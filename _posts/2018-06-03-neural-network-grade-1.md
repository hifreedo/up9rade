## Neural Network
##### grade 1

It's the initial post of series: neural network.

The languages will be implemented here are: javascript and processing.

Reason for choosing these 2, is they are easy to visualize and provides friendly interaction, which will help out in understanding "how".

I believe in make "something" visible requires comprehensive understanding on "something".

Won't start from introduction of neuron & brain science etc, as these staffs could be easily get online. Instead, let's start by neuron from machine learning perspective.

Neural network has wide usage in all sorts of machine learning scenarios. As skyscraper was made of tiny bricks, the neural network was made of "perceptrons".

Following is the diagram of simplest and basic unit of network, a processor. With millions even billions of perceptrons communicate to each other, a sophasticated system was built on top of it.

The target of grade 1: to build a linear classifier , which could classify 2 categories in a 2 dimension space.

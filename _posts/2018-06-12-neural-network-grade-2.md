## Neural Network
##### grade 2: single perceptron with linear classification

Subject for grade 2 is to develop a linear classification with single perceptron.

Grade 2:
Let's see what does a "neuron" really get.
We will come up with a scenario, commence a classification problem: linearly split a 2D space.

To accomplish this, the concept of "training" - (tweak outputs according to training set will be introduced) .

During training process:
How to represent "error":
How to adjust weight

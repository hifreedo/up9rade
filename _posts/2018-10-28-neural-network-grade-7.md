# Mini RNN

## grade 7: mini RNN

Following we will implement a simple version of RNN.
And we will go back to CNN on more details later. : )

While CNN overcomes the issue of computational complexity over traditional full connection networks, it has its own shortcoming, it has no memory on previous events.

For instance, if a CNN robot sitting in the cinema watching a movie, most likely it won't understand what's going on and what's the story, unlike human, the CNN won't memorize previous scenes to help understand what's happening and what will be in the near future.

With saying that, a RNN is not that mysterious, still it could be looked as a CNN, in some way.

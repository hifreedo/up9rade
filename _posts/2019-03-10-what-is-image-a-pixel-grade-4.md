# What is image file: behind a pixel

## grade 4: behind a pixel

Let's try to dig what's behind an image from a popular website, i.e. amazon, facebook.

Right click the mouse, choose open image in new tab, and you will see a long url like the following:

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/US-hq/2019/img/Certified_Refurbished/XCM_Manual_1161174_renewed_card_resize_260x260_Certified_Refurbished_XCM_Manual_1161174_us_certified_refurbished_renewed_card_resize_260x260_1550730012_jpg._CB454883446_SY260_.jpg

https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22048040_10156538213601729_8575083799156884904_o.png?_nc_cat=1&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&oh=e6b2bb360c8688d9f309a6353d3e339c&oe=5D21A654

First of all, the image comes with a height & width in pixels, for e.g. we see 260x260 from amazon.

What's the actual file size aka how much disk space will it take to save a 260x260 pixels image?

# Convolution with CNN

## grade 8: Convolution with CNN

There's a very comprehensive introduction on convolutional neural networks from [cs231n](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/).

We will focus on how to implement a cnn from scratch (with numpy), and apply it on mnist dataset.

Key steps for implementation:

1. Convolutional operation;
2. Back propagation;

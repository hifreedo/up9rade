## series 1: Volume of Cone

We will calculate volumes by cross sections with helps of definite integral.

Let's first look at type of cross section 1:

Let's denote radius of cross section of "y", now we are going to figure out formula of it:

$$ \tan\theta = \frac yx = \frac rh $$

$$ y = \frac rh * x $$

$$ \int_{x=0}^{x=h}\pi(\frac rh * x)^2dx = \pi(\frac rh)^2\int_{x=0}^{x=h}x^2dx $$

$$ V = \pi(\frac rh)^2\frac {h^3} {3} = \frac 13\pi r^2h $$

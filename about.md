**About up9rade**:

Mainly focus on machine learning and deep learning, and try to explain things in visualized and easy to interpreted way.

For the main series, will present many grades' challenges.

Will not cover the following:

* If there's already a clear explanation in wikipedia

* Background information as there are too much online materials available

* Abc knowledge if which I could not supply with my own explanation or intuition

Will cover the following:

* Implement something from scratch, aka write a multilayer network from implementing matrix operation

* Link cross domain spots together, aim to have a deeper understanding on certain area

**Intuition about this site**:

Keep trying and learning, until found your own right intuition.

**Interesting factors about the posts**:

You will find majority of the posts are in status of : ongoing and unfinished.

By asking what is what? What is what of what?
Constructing knowledge system wider and deeper, it's a way to reconnect isolated islands and just like the neurons connect with each other.

It's a cheerful journey because you will find something never been taught through textbooks.

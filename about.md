**About up9rade**:

Mainly focus on machine learning and deep learning, and try to explain things in visualized and easy to be interpreted way.

More like a draft about machine learning and mathematics, about image and miscellany.

The good side about it's positioning of draft: keeps updating with learning.

Will NOT cover the following:

* If there's already a clear & better explanation in wikipedia

* Background information as there are too much online materials available

* Abc knowledge if which I could not supply with my own explanation or intuition

Will cover the following:

* Implement something from scratch, aka write a multilayer network from implementing matrix operation

* Link cross domain spots together, aim to have a deeper understanding on certain area

**Intuition about this site**:

Keep trying and learning, until found your own right intuition.

**Interesting factors about the posts**:

You will find majority of the posts are in status of : ongoing and unfinished.
You may read from grade 1 if you are new in related field.

By asking what is what? What is what of what?
Constructing knowledge system wider and deeper, it's a way to reconnect isolated islands and just like the neurons connect with each other.

It's a cheerful journey because you will find something never been taught through textbooks.
